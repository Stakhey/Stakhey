# Who Is @Stakhey? #

👋 Hello, I’m @Stakhey! <br />
👔 My dream job is to become a YouTuber, or an indie game developer. I want to make my own living in life. <br />
🌱 In my programming journey, I am currently learning Python. However, I would love to learn about web development, as well as C# for game development. <br />
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small fun projects, such as a game or a bot. <br />
💻 The hobby I could never give up is programming, as it is technical yet also lets you get your creative juices flowing. <br />
⛄ My favourite season is winter, beacause the festive spirit is unmatchable, and I love rain and cold weather. <br />
⚽ I support Manchester City and have done since I was 3 years old. <br />
🍦 My favourite ice cream flavour is vanilla. Simple yet classic. <br />
🎶 My favourite type of music is LoFi, or game music, as it helps me focus while doing work. <br />
🏏 The most boring sport to ever exist is cricket. Change my mind... <br />
🌑 The thing I'm most scared of is the dark, as I don't like it when I don't know something. <br />
🔊 In my opinion, the most annoying word is "obviously", and the worst phrase is "I can't even."  
🐶 My biggest pet peeve is when people use unecessarily long words to sound much smarter than they really are. <br />
💬 I can speak English and Russian, I'm learning how to speak Chinese and Spanish, and in the future I would like to learn how to speak Japanese or ASL.<br /> 
🎹 I can play the flute (arguably!). <br />
🐔 I once played Professor Marvel in my school production of The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz. <br />
🏁 I can play chess reasonably well, coming #1 in England in an U10 British Championship, and currrently having a live Lichess rating of over 1950+. <br />
🧳 Something I want to do in life is to travel the world, as I find it fascinating how one world can have so much variety between cultures. <br />
😃 I have a sister and a half-sister. <br />
🐈 I have a small, cute white cat called Demi that was born in Lithuania, and loves eating food (suprise!). <br />
🎮My friends and I most often talk about videogames, especially Nintendo. <br />
💦 My nickname is Sweaty Stakhey, because I'm always trying hard at whatever I do, and my friends enjoy teasing me about my tendency to overachieve in different areas of life. <br />
📚 My favourite subject at school is/was histroy, especially from the 1900s, as I love to learn about how society has come to this state. <br />
🍣 I have never, ever tried sushi. <br />
🌞 My first thought when I wake up is normally, "I hate the sound of my alarm..." <br />
⏳ If I could have any superpower, it would be time control, as it would be very cool to freeze time, or o backi in time to change things for the better. <br />

🥅 One of my goals here on GitHub is to stay active daily, and one day expand this lost to 100 facts about myself! <br />
