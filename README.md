<h1 align="center">You alright? I'm Stakhey :) </h1>
<h3 align="center">Doesn't the matrix know everything about me already...?</h3>

<p> Given that there’s nothing to hide, I’m 17 and currently based in London.

If I’m at my desk, I’m probably working on projects in C++ in the hopes of exploring cybersecurity in the future, or listening to post-punk tunes while searching for my next internet rabbit hole, which ranges from philosophical musings to smashing controllers.

Offline, I’m currently a student of the IB Diploma. Outside of this suffering, you might catch me representing my country at chess, performing in musicals or falling off walls at the climbing gym, amongst various other side quests such as reading and running.
